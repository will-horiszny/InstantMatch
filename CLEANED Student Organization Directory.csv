MBAs for Christ,Religious,"MBAs for Christ exists to glorify God by encouraging graduate JSOM Students in
their devotion and submission to Jesus Christ. This organization is “religious,” as defined by the
SOC.
We affirm the following core values:
1.Our Identity is in Christ“...for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by
his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 3:23-24)Despite the
pressures of the professional world, we deny that our identity, purpose, or personal worth is found
in our professional success, productivity, or performance. Rather, we affirm that our lives are in
Jesus Christ, the One who has justified and redeemed us through His broken body and spilt blood.
2.Our Purpose is to Pursue Christ“See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty
deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not
according to Christ. For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have been filled in
him, who is the head of all rule and authority.” (Colossians2:8-10)Even as we learn important
business lessons as graduate students at UTD, we affirm our reliance on and submission to Jesus
Christ. We commit to pursuing Christ in all things, trusting in His sufficiency, authority, and
wisdom. We choose to exalt Jesus, His perspective, and His wisdom above all else.3.Our Work is our
Worship “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the
Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.” (Colossians
3:23-24)As working professionals and students, we believe our careers are an offering unto Jesus
Christ. As such, we seek to integrate our faith and work under the leadership of the Holy Spirit and
unto the glory of our Father in Heaven.
4.Our Unity is in our Devotion to Christ and our Love for One Another “This is my commandment,
that you love one another as I have loved you.” (John 15:12)
In accordance with the historic creeds of the church (that is, the Nicene Creed and the Apostle’s
Creed, see Appendix A), we affirm that our love for Jesus Christ compels us to love one another as
He first loved us. In all things, we seek to show Christ-like love in word and deed to our fellow
JSOM students, our co-workers, and our communities",Blake Carrington,btc230000@utdallas.edu,/sites/StudentOrganizationCenterSP/Lists/Student%20Organization%20Directory/Attachments/762/mbafc.PNG

We also volunteer with Prevent Blindness in Texas, the Hot Chocolate Run in Dallas, and more! Volunteering has given us the opportunity to grow stronger as an organization and empower our community.
Some of the greatest UTD POPS traditions are the trips we take during the second semester. There are fun social trips like surviving escape rooms, and informative trips such as touring Optometry graduate schools like the University of Houston. These outings really solidify the bonds of our members and aid us in our future as an Optometrist. Whether you are thinking of becoming an optometrist, definitive about your optometry future, or just looking for a little fun, POPS trips are memories that you will cherish for a lifetime.
In order to keep the organization running, we bring the community together through multiple fundraisers each semester.

Student Tutors Reviving Identity through Volunteerism and Education,"Academic Interests, Educational/Departmental, Services","STRIVE was founded in 2019 to help underprivileged students in the DFW metroplex have the chance to live up to their true potential. Our initiative first started as a means for Refugee and ESL students to work with select mentors. Our work focused on helping the students overcome language barriers, learn that diversity is indeed accepted, and to think beyond primary education. This initiative was a success as we had a lot of students interested in higher education after various discussions.
Unfortunately, many of them struggled to gain acceptance due to the compounding effects of the language barrier. Without a solid grasp of English, performance in various other subjects takes a significant hit. Based on this dilemma, we decided that it was essential to develop a tutoring program for these students to connect them with tutor-mentors from similar backgrounds who would guide the students and allow them to overcome this barrier.
We see a bright future for these students, and we want to tap into their potential by providing them with one-on-one subject strategy training and educational advice. Our motto is that every student should have the right to succeed regardless of their background. Language should not be an obstacle to success. We currently work with Lake Highlands High School in the Richardson Independent School District (RISD). Currently looking to expand, we look forward to continuing our mission to eliminate educational disparities.",Zaid Memon,Zaid.Memon@UTDallas.edu,/sites/StudentOrganizationCenterSP/Lists/Student%20Organization%20Directory/Attachments/1030/252fStudent2blist252f5742bLogo2b2022_Khadija%252bShariff.png

Our hope is that through deep friendships, camaraderie, adventure and community that students will feel deeply connected to one another as well as connected better to their campus. Our beliefs are that every student has a God given purpose for their lives, and in that they can find true peace and inspiration for their gifts and design. We are super inviting to any and all students on campus, and we plan to support every student in every way possible both with mentorships and friendships.",Leah Varghese,lmv200000@utdallas.edu,/sites/StudentOrganizationCenterSP/Shared%20Documents/Apps/Microsoft%20Forms/Organization%20Registration%20Form/Cover%20Image/YL_Leah%20Varghese.jpg
